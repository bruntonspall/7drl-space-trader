Rogue crossed with Elite

## Basic Idea

You are a sole trader, armed with a small warship with a modest cargo bay, you have decided to take part in the great intergalatic future.
Trading cargo from system to system, carrying slaves or warmachines, or prey on those who do.  Alternately, take up with the police federation and hunt down the greatest space pirates of all time.  The future is yours.

## Code Ideas

* Multiple windows within a screen
* Turn based
* Random Universe each play
* Random economic events (I.e. systems declare war, ally, famine etc)
* Economic market on systems.

## First todo's

* Get up and running with something like curses and a window
* Random map generation
* Ability to move around (Newtonian physics or normal roguelike?)
* Docking with systems
* Intership combat
* Policeforce for piracy
* Random pirates
